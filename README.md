# Voidbar

Discord-compatible IRCv3 bouncer (like [Spacebar](https://www.spacebar.chat/), but for IRC).

Voidbar speaks the Discord protocol (REST + Gateway) on one side and connects to
IRC networks on the other, so a real Discord client can be used to chat on IRC.

## Concept

- **A guild is an IRC connection string.** There are no preconfigured guilds:
  pasting a connection string as an invite creates (or joins) a network, and each
  member gets their own upstream IRC connection with their own nick.
- **Multi-user.** Each user registers, joins networks by connection string, and
  holds independent connections to the same IRC server.
- **Bouncer semantics.** Upstream connections persist independently of client
  sessions; message history is buffered and replayed on reconnect.

## Status

Work in progress — initial scaffolding only.

## Planned stack

- Go 1.22+
- Embedded [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger)
- IRCv3: SASL, server-time, message-tags, away-notify, account-notify, batches,
  multiline, nick v3, `+typing`, `+react`/`+unreact`, `draft/message-redaction`,
  `draft/ICON` (network icon)
- Discord Gateway v10 + REST v9 (scoped to frozen client builds)
